# Awesome LD\_PRELOAD

This is a list of resources related to LD\_PRELOAD, a mechanism for changing
application behavior at run-time.  Libraries can override specified functions
with another, for example, making `time(3)` always return 0.  This is often
useful for testing or modifying application behavior without source code
changes.

To use, set the environment variable
`LD_PRELOAD=/full/path/to/your_shared_lib.so` before launching your
application.

LD\_PRELOAD works on Linux systems and some BSDs.  macOS implements similar
functionality via DYLD\_INSERT\_LIBRARIES.

## Libraries

* [flockit](https://github.com/smerritt/flockit) - add file locking to programs that don't do it
* [fluxcapacitor](https://github.com/majek/fluxcapacitor) - a tool for making your program run without blocking on timeouts, on functions like poll and select
* [force-urandom](https://github.com/AGWA/force-urandom) - force programs to use fast and secure /dev/urandom instead of pointlessly slow /dev/random
